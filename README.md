# Excel-Sales-Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to my Excel Data Analytics project repository! In this project, I leveraged the robust capabilities of Microsoft Excel, particularly harnessing the power of Power Query for efficient data transformation. Utilizing Pivot Tables, XLOOKUP, and VLOOKUP functions, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a realistic dataset from a hardware company. The primary objective was to extract valuable insights into the company's sales, profits, and customer performance across monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. The project is meticulously organized into various worksheets, each showcasing distinct analyses and calculations powered by these advanced Excel functionalities.
